A dashboard for your home :)

My first steps on JQuery / bootstrap / bootswatch / boilerplate / json / api

For now it aim's to be skinny for Domoticz, but I try to get it as pluggable as possible.

Host the files in the www-root of Domoticz to get them do stuff.

**Disclaimer**
It probably doesn't work
It's probably badly coded (help is welcome)
It's very Domoticz specific
