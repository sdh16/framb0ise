A dashboard for Domoticz

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/safi78/framb0ise/master/screenshots/dashboard.png)


My first babysteps on JQuery / bootstrap / bootswatch / boilerplate / json / api

For now it aim's to be a skin/theme for Domoticz, but I try to get it as pluggable as possible.

Host the files in the www-root of Domoticz to get them do stuff.

**Disclaimer**

It probably doesn't work

It's probably badly coded (help is welcome)

It's very Domoticz specific

but it looks awesome & it works... somewhat ...
