framb0ise: A dashboard for Domoticz!
=========

Domoticz is great but the interface at the moment isn't.  
So we started a topic to gather a team. But the animo was not as we exspected.
Safi78 started to took another approach. instead or thinking/discuss and talk we started to script :)
after a couple of talks with remb0, the goal was clear. 

We build a template, with minimal requirements which can be extend in the feature and maybe it can replace the current GUI.
Our first babysteps on JQuery / bootstrap / bootswatch / boilerplate / json / api.
For now it aim's to be a skin/theme for Domoticz, but we try to get it as pluggable as possible.
