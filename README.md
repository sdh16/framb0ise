framb0ise: A dashboard for Domoticz!
=========

Domoticz is a great controller, but the interface could be improved here and there. We understand and really appreciate that the developers focus on adding functionality instead of making it look 'pretty'. 
 
So we started a topic trying to get a team together, but the responses weren't as we expected.

We to took another approach: A little less conversation, a little more action please ... :)

These are our first babysteps on JQuery / bootstrap / bootswatch / boilerplate / json / api, but we are fast learners.

For now it aim's to be a skin/theme for Domoticz and we try to make it as pluggable as possible.
