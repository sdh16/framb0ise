framb0ise: A dashboard for Domoticz!
=========

Domoticz is great but the interface could be improved here and there. We understand and really like that the developers focus on adding functionality instead of making it look 'pretty'. 
 
So we started a topic trying to get a team together, but the responses were not as we exspected.

We to took another approach: A little less conversation, a little more action please ... :)
 
We build a template, with minimal requirements which can be extend in the feature and maybe it can replace the current GUI.

These are our first babysteps on JQuery / bootstrap / bootswatch / boilerplate / json / api.

For now it aim's to be a skin/theme for Domoticz, but we try to get it as pluggable as possible.

=======
